# brainfuck-interpreter
This implementation provides a basic interpreter for Brainfuck, but it may not handle all edge cases or optimize performance.

The language consists of only eight commands:


1. `>` Move the data pointer to the right.
2. `<` Move the data pointer to the left.
3. `+` Increment the value in the current cell.
4. `-` Decrement the value in the current cell.
5. `.` Output the value in the current cell as a character.
6. `,` Read a character of input and store it in the current cell.
7. `[` Jump forward to the corresponding ] if the value in the current cell is zero.
8. `]` Jump back to the corresponding [ if the value in the current cell is not zero.

Note that the interpreter I provided is a basic implementation and may not handle complex Brainfuck programs or certain language variations.<br>
However, it should work fine for simple programs and can be a starting point for building a more robust interpreter if needed.
